<h2>Introduction to Backgammon</h2>
<p>Backgammon is a board game for two players, the objective of the game is to remove all your pieces from the board before your opponent.</p>
<br>
<h2>Moving Checkers</h2>
<p>At the start of the game, Pocket BG will throw a single die for each player and the player with the higher number will start moving using both dice rolled.
 After the first turn the players will alternate turns, rolling the dice at the start of their turns.</p>

<p>The players move their checkers forward according to the number of points on each die.
 Checkers can only be moved to points occupied by the player's own checkers, empty points or points with only one opposing checker.</p>

<p>Players must move using both dice if there are valid moves, if it's only possible to move once then the highest humber has to be played.
If a player rolls the same number twice then that player must play each die twice, or as many times as possible.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Hitting and Entering</h2>
<p>If a checker is moved to a point with exactly one opposing checker, the opposing checker is hit and moved to the bar between the two sides of the boards.</p>
<p>Checkers on the bar have to re-enter the game through the opponent's home board. Players are not allowed to move any other checkers while they have checkers on the bar.</p>
<br>
<h2>Bearing off</h2>
<p>When a player moves all of their checkers to their home board they are allowed to start removing checkers from the board.</p>
<p>A die is used to remove checkers from the point corresponding to its value, if there are no checkers on a higher point then that die may be used to remove a checker from a lower point.</p>
<br>
<h2>Scoring</h2>
<p>If by the time a player is done bearing off all his checkers the opposing player has not removed any of their checkers then that player lost a gammon, which counts for double a normal loss</p>
<p>If a player has not borne off any checkers and has checkers in the opponent's home board or bar then the player lost a backgammon for triple a normal loss</p>
