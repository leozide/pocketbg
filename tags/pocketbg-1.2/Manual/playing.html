<h2>Playing the Game</h2>
<p>To start a new match simply tap the "New Match" button from the Main Menu. You can select the match length, difficulty and other options by tapping the
"Settings" button before starting the match.</p>
<br>
<h2>Playing a Turn</h2>
<p>If the doubling cube is enabled, under certain conditions you can offer a doubling to your opponent by tapping on the cube before rolling the dice.</p>
<p>You can resign a game any time during your turn by going to the game menu and choosing the resign option. You will then be prompted for the resignation type.</p>
<p>Once you're ready, tap on your home board to roll the dice. Note that if the doubling cube isn't available, Pocket BG will automatically roll the dice for you.</p>
<br>
<h2>Moving checkers</h2>
<p>There are several ways to move checkers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tap on a checker to move it using the left die, if that move is not valid Pocket BG will try to use the right die instead. Tapping the dice will swap them.<br>
<li>Hold your finger on a checker for at least half a second and then tap the destination point.<br>
<li>Tap an empty point or a point with one opposing checker to automatically take it with up to two of your closest checkers.<br>
<li>Drag and drop a checker where you want it moved.<br>
<li>Tap on the bearoff tray if you can bearoff with both dice.<br>
</ul>
<p>Once you are done moving, tap the dice to end your turn. You can undo a move by either moving the pieces back to their original positions or tapping on the undo area.</p>
